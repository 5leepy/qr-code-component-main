### Useful resources

- https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/ - This helped me to reset my css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4&t=6s&ab_channel=CoderCoder - I've been looking all over youtube for a tutorial on Sass. Most of them are outdated and still use @import instead of @use and @forward I'm more of a visual learner, even though I read the documentation on the Sass website I still couldn't figure it out but this video is quite clear.
